### Event: Paradox (City/Rare)
    
<only triggered if the player has the Paradox curse in their deck>
While wandering the crumbling streets of what was clearly a mighty city long ago, you suddenly get the feeling that you're being followed.

You pickup the pace more and more as you try to loose your shadow. Finally, after a series of quick turns and not a small amount of parkour, you stop to catch your breath, satisfied that they've well and truly lost your trail.

"That's an dangerous thing you've got there"

You lookup in complete shock at the voice above you. Hanging there, their face mere inches from your own, is a figure warped in a black cloak, their features almost completely hidden in shadow.

"I can "dispose" of it for you, if you'd like? I'll even let you keep the bottle" The thing grins unnaturally wide.

Something about all this seems wrong.

"Do we have a deal?"

Agree: Remove Paradox from your deck. Something seems wrong...
