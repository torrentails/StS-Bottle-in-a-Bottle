*I heard you like bottles, so I put a bottle in your bottle*

A mod for Slay the Spire, featuring a collection of miscellaneous relics and other bits and bobs

## Implemented content
### Keywords
- **Persistent:** Retain at the end of turn and cannot be exhausted or discarded.

### Cards
- **Paradox:** (*X cost, Curse*)  
Soulbound, Persistent, Purge.  
If this card is in your hand at the end of your turn, loose life equal to half your current hp.  
(This card's cost becomes equal to the card picked for Bottled Time.)


### Relics
- **Bottled Time:** (*Rare*)  
Remove a card and add a special Curse to your deck with equal cost. Play the chosen card for free at the start of each combat.

- **Stamina Bar:** (*Rare*)  
Gain 4 Strength and 4 Dexterity at the start of combat. At the end of your first turn, lose 5 Strength and 5 Dexterity.

- **Gold Armour** (*Rare*)  
On pickup, gain gold equal to 3 times your max HP and your max HP becomes 1. Damage is dealt to your gold supply before your HP. Whenever you would gain max HP, instead gain three times that much gold.  
***Note:*** SFX not done. Don't use unless you like an infinitely spawning gold effect!

- **Pre-Charger** (*Boss*)  
At the start of combat, each card in your deck that costs 2 or more costs 1 less until played.
